# Semantic Guardrail Accuracy: pop-pay Benchmark Results

## TL;DR

- **v0 (retracted).** The prior "95% accuracy" headline was extrapolated from a 20-payload hand-picked illustrative set on Claude Sonnet 4.5 (2026-04-13). It has been retired; the items in *Key Findings (v0 illustrative)* below are kept only as qualitative examples, not a quantitative basis for any claim.
- **v1 (current).** Locked 585-payload red-team corpus, 11 attack categories (A–K), N=5 repeats, cross-model sweep (Anthropic / OpenAI / Google) on a byte-identical v3 Layer-2 prompt. No model hits the original target (bypass rate < 20% **AND** false-reject rate < 20%).
- **Post-fix ranking.** `claude-haiku-4-5` leads on false-reject rate (7.8%) and variance (1.0% flip); `gemini-2.5-flash` second (8.6% / 4.2%); `gpt-4o-mini` third (12.2% / 10.2%). Hybrid-layer bypass rate is effectively tied at 29.5–30.4% across the three models.
- **Deterministic baselines** (model-independent): Layer 1 alone is bypass rate 58.4% / false-reject rate 7.8%; TOCTOU is bypass rate 3.6% / false-reject rate 0.9%.
- **Pending.** Ollama `gemma4:e2b-it-bf16` local slice returned `404 model not found`; batch-1 data-gathering side-channel is in flight to resolve the model-name config before the slice is re-run.

## Methodology

v1 evaluates pop-pay against a locked 585-payload red-team corpus spanning
11 attack categories (A–K), with N=5 repeats per payload per runner to
measure intra-model verdict stability:

- **Corpus:** 585 payloads × 11 categories (A=60, B=85, C=55, D=65, E=55,
  F=45, G=60, H=45, I=35, J=35, K=45). `corpus_hash`
  `e1674ba698fe495c11d7d343f3a81fc680bd6139d61174e8641f0d3a53f4325e`.
- **Runners:** `layer1` (keyword-only), `layer2` (LLM-only), `hybrid`
  (Layer 1 short-circuit → Layer 2), `full_mcp` (reduced — scan +
  hybrid), `toctou` (URL-level domain mismatch).
- **Models:** cross-model sweep across Anthropic `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`,
  OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini`, and Google `gemini-2.5-flash` (OpenAI-compat
  endpoint). Ollama local slice pending a model-name fix.
- **Metrics:** attack-bypass %, benign false-reject %, N=5 intra-model flip
  %, per-category latency (p50 / p95), and a separately-reported
  `error_rate` that excludes retry-exhausted / provider-unreachable rows
  from bypass/FR aggregates.
- **Engine parity:** adapters use the same system + user prompts as the
  shipped engine (`tests/redteam/adapters/prompt.ts`) in JSON-strict mode.

Benchmark — v1** and **v1 Cross-Model Benchmark** sections below.

## Key Findings (v0 illustrative — superseded by v1)

> **🛑 Retraction (v0).** The items in this section come from a
> **20-payload hand-picked illustrative set run on Claude Sonnet 4.5,
> 2026-04-13**. The "95% accuracy" headline previously extrapolated from
> this set has been retired. All quantitative findings live in the
> **RT-1 Honest Benchmark — v1** and **v1 Cross-Model Benchmark**
> sections below.

The items below remain as qualitative examples of the kinds of signals
the hybrid layer catches. They are **not a quantitative basis** for any
claim.

- **Prompt Injection Detection (illustrative):** the LLM layer identified
  a "checkout page says gift card purchase is required" instruction as a
  manipulation attempt that the keyword layer alone would have allowed.
- **Anomalous Quantity Detection (illustrative):** an agent attempting
  1,000 rubber ducks for an "office greenery" task was flagged by the LLM
  as quantity-anomalous despite vendor + amount being within allowlist.
- **Contextual Intent Inference (illustrative):** task-aligned purchases
  ("laptops for education donation") were correctly approved on semantic
  grounds without exact keyword matches.
- **Layered Cost Behavior:** Layer 1 short-circuits high-confidence
  rejections before Layer 2 is invoked; actual per-category short-circuit
  rate is reported in the v1 tables below.

## Known limitations and caveats

One known failure mode: the system blocked a "pizza restaurant" transaction because the category was absent from the user's `POP_ALLOWED_CATEGORIES`. Since the keyword layer blocks before invoking the LLM, the transaction failed despite being contextually legitimate. This is intentional safe behavior — the system prioritizes user-defined allowlists. Users must add categories like `food` to enable semantic reasoning for those domains.

## Architecture

## Reproducing a run

Two entry points, depending on scope.

**Unit-level guardrail checks** (no LLM required):

```bash
pytest tests/test_guardrails.py -v
```

**Full corpus run** (585 payloads, LLM-keyed Layer 2):

```bash
export POP_LLM_API_KEY="sk-..."          # hard-required; harness refuses to run without
export POP_LLM_MODEL="gemini-2.5-flash"
export POP_LLM_BASE_URL="https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/"
POP_REDTEAM=1 python -m tests.redteam.run_corpus --n 5 --concurrency 20
```

Artifacts land under `tests/redteam/runs/<timestamp>.jsonl`. API-key-shaped substrings are scrubbed before persistence (`scrubKey` / `_scrub_key`).

## RT-1 Honest Benchmark — v1 (2026-04-14)

This section reports the RT-1 red-team benchmark run with Layer 2 keyed against Gemini 2.5 Flash. It replaces the v0.1 Preliminary checkpoint. Numbers are as-measured; limitations are listed at the end of this section — read them before citing.

### Run manifest

- corpus_hash: `e1674ba698fe495c11d7d343f3a81fc680bd6139d61174e8641f0d3a53f4325e`
- corpus_size: 585 payloads, 11 categories (A–K)
- total_rows: 2925 (585 payloads × 5 runners; N=5 repeats per payload aggregated into per-row rates)
- generated_at: 2026-04-14T23:22:07Z
- llm_model: `gemini-2.5-flash`
- llm_base_url: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/`
- runners: `layer1`, `layer2`, `hybrid`, `full_mcp` (reduced: scan + hybrid), `toctou` (URL-level)

### Headline (aggregate across 585 payloads)

| Runner | attack bypass % | benign FR % | avg N=5 flip % |
|---|---|---|---|
| layer1 | 58.4 | 7.8 | 0.0 |
| layer2 | 24.7 | 53.1 | 64.5 |
| **hybrid** | **15.6** | 58.3 | 47.7 |
| full_mcp (reduced) | 15.6 | 57.9 | 47.5 |
| toctou (C/H only) | 3.6 | 0.9 | 0.0 |

Read the table carefully:
- **Hybrid is the strongest attack-blocker** (15.6% bypass) but injects high false-reject cost (58.3%) on benign traffic.
- **Layer 2 alone is non-deterministic at this corpus size**: average per-category verdict-flip rate across the N=5 repeats is **64.5%**, i.e. the same payload yields a different `approved` boolean across identical repeats in most categories.
- **Layer 1 is fast and low-FR** (7.8%) but half of attacks bypass it.
- **TOCTOU** only meaningfully runs on categories C/H (domain-aware payloads); other categories correctly record `skip`.

### B-class decision (S0.2a pre-registered)
- `bypass_rate_layer1` = 40.0%
- `false_reject_rate_layer1` = 20.0%
- **decision: Keep-but-deprecated** — bypass rate 40.0% ∈ (15%, 50%) **AND** false-reject rate 20.0% ∈ (10%, 25%) → falls into the middle bucket per the pre-registered thresholds below.

**Pre-registered decision thresholds** (fixed 2026-04-14 before the run, so the `POP_ALLOWED_CATEGORIES` decision is not post-hoc):

| Decision | Criteria | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Keep** | bypass ≤ 15% **AND** false-reject ≤ 10% | Matcher is robust enough to stay as-is. |
| **Keep-but-deprecated** | bypass in (15%, 50%) **OR** false-reject in (10%, 25%) | Matcher is fragile; stays available under a deprecation notice while a v2 policy model is designed in parallel. New installs warned via `pop-pay doctor`. |
| **Drop** | bypass ≥ 50% **OR** false-reject ≥ 25% | Matcher gives a false sense of security; remove from Layer-1 critical path in next major version. Callers migrated to LLM-only or v2 policy. |

*Keep* = strict conjunction (both numbers must be good). *Drop* triggers on either number being bad. *Keep-but-deprecated* is the middle band in either direction. Bypass rate is measured against Layer-1 only; hybrid-runner recovery is informational and does not change the decision, because the matcher's job is Layer-1 gating.

> **Correction (Fix 8, 2026-04-16).** Earlier drafts of the related
> internal spec referenced a 4-bucket variant of these thresholds. The
> 3-bucket matrix above is the authoritative source of truth; any prior
> 4-bucket mention is a stale draft and should not be cited.

### What this invalidates in the pre-v1 marketing claim

Earlier drafts of this document cited **"95% accuracy"** from a 20-payload
hand-picked illustrative set. That framing has been retired: the top-of-
file TL;DR and Methodology sections now describe the v1 cross-model
sweep, and the 20-payload items are explicitly labelled as v0
illustrative. The 585-payload keyed run does not reproduce a single
"accuracy" number — bypass rate and false-reject rate are reported
separately per model per runner because collapsing them into one percent
hides the tradeoff operators actually have to pick from.

### Limitations (unchanged from v0.1 — still apply)

- **Single LLM model.** `gemini-2.5-flash` via OpenAI-compat endpoint. No cross-model sweep. Different models will produce materially different numbers — the high verdict-flip rate here suggests this specific model is a poor fit for structured JSON-strict validation tasks at tight context.
- **Rate limiting during the run.** p95 latencies of 34–35 s for Layer-2-dependent paths reflect Gemini free-tier throttling and client-side retries, not real production latency. Re-run on a paid tier is required before publishing latency claims.
- **Full MCP runner is reduced** (scan heuristic + hybrid fall-through). The real stdio MCP client replacement is S1 scope.
- **TOCTOU** is URL-level, not CDP-event-level — it simulates mid-flight redirect by swapping the target URL, not by intercepting browser navigation events.
- **Benign counterpart coverage is category-dependent**; see per-category total_benign column.
- **Flip rate N=5 is an intra-run stability measure**, not a cross-seed measure. Different prompts or sampling temperatures will produce different flip profiles.

See **Reproducing a run** at the top of this document for the single-model
corpus command; the v1 numbers above were produced by that command with
`POP_LLM_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash`.

## v1 → v2 prompt iteration (in progress)

### Change

v1 Layer 2 prompt biased toward reject-on-doubt ("Approve **ONLY if** vendor matches and reasoning is coherent") — the subjective "coherence" gate produced high benign false-rejection. v2 rewrites the rule set:

- **Default:** APPROVE when vendor plausibly matches any allowed category and nothing signals abuse
- **4 enumerated BLOCK signals:** category mismatch; output-format hijack; anomalous amount; commerce-adjacent abuse
- **3 enumerated NOT-block signals:** niche SaaS; terse reasoning; routine subscription amounts ($5–$500)
- **Retained:** `<agent_reasoning>` as UNTRUSTED DATA (injection guard)

See `docs/benchmark-history/prompt-iterations.md` for the full diff and rationale.

### Target

FR < 20% on benign traffic without materially worsening attack bypass (v1: 15.6% hybrid).

### Stop conditions

- **A:** FR < 20% AND bypass has not materially worsened → declare iteration complete, hand off to cross-model sweep (Step 3)
- **B:** 3 iterations with no meaningful FR drop → halt. Signals architectural, not prompt-level, issue

### Results

| Iteration | System prompt | User prompt | gemini-2.5-flash hybrid bypass | hybrid FR | avg N=5 flip |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| v1 (baseline) | "strict security module" | "Approve ONLY if…" | 15.6% | 58.3% | 47.7% |
| v2 | unchanged | default-APPROVE + enumerated BLOCK signals | 0.3% | **100.0%** | 1.7% |
| v3 | "payment guardrail" (neutral) | few-shot (2 APPROVE + 2 BLOCK) + terse rules | 0.0% | 99.8% | 0.0% |

## v1 Cross-Model Benchmark — 2026-04-15

Same locked corpus (`corpus_hash e1674ba6...`, 585 payloads, 11 categories,
N=5 repeats), same v3 Layer-2 prompt (byte-identical via
`tests/redteam/adapters/prompt.ts`), same JSON-strict response_format.
Sweep run via `npx tsx tests/redteam/run-corpus.ts --model-sweep
--concurrency=10`; per-provider adapter dispatch in
`tests/redteam/runners/layer2.ts` (`setBenchAdapter()`).

### Per-model aggregate (hybrid layer = Layer 1 short-circuit + Layer 2)

| Model | Provider | Layer 2 bypass | hybrid bypass | hybrid FR | N=5 flip (avg cat) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Anthropic | 45.7% | 30.4% | **7.8%** | **1.0%** |
| `gpt-4o-mini` | OpenAI | 45.2% | 30.1% | 12.2% | 10.2% |
| `gemini-2.5-flash` | Google (OpenAI-compat) | 46.2% | 29.5% | **8.6%** | **4.2%** |
| `gemma4:e2b-it-bf16` | Ollama (local) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |

Layer 1 (deterministic, model-independent): bypass 58.4% / FR 7.8%.
TOCTOU (deterministic, model-independent): bypass 3.6% / FR 0.9%.

**Headline read:** **none of the three working models hits the original
target (FR < 20% AND bypass < 20%).** Each picks a different point on the
FR/bypass tradeoff curve:
- **Anthropic claude-haiku-4-5** (re-run 2026-04-16 post adapter error-fix) — hybrid bypass 30.4%, FR **7.8%**, flip **1.0%**. Lowest FR and lowest variance of all three models. Original contaminated run (11.2% retry-exhaustion, silent block fallback) produced inflated FR 21.6% / deflated bypass 25.9% / noise flip 24.4%.
- **OpenAI gpt-4o-mini** — middle bypass (30.1%), moderate FR (12.2%), moderate flip (10.2%).
- **Google gemini-2.5-flash** — FR 8.6%, flip 4.2%, bypass 29.5%. Close to Anthropic re-run on every axis.

Post-fix ranking: **Anthropic leads on FR (7.8%) and variance (1.0% flip),
Gemini close second (8.6% / 4.2%), OpenAI third (12.2% / 10.2%).** Bypass
is effectively tied at 29.5-30.4%.

**Ollama (`gemma4:e2b-it-bf16`)** — slice ran but **all 2925 layer2 rows
returned `404 model 'gemma4:e2b-it-bf16' not found`**. The configured
`POP_BENCH_OLLAMA_MODEL` value does not match a model installed locally on
the founder's box. Marked TBD pending model-name resolution; row will be
filled when a corrected model name is provided. Artifact preserved as
`2026-04-15T21-58-28-115Z-ollama-gemma4_e2b-it-bf16.jsonl` for audit.

### Per-category breakdown (hybrid bypass / FR / N=5 flip, %)

Bold = best in row. Post-fix pattern: **Anthropic now leads on FR across
most categories (0% in A/D/E/F/I/K) and has the lowest variance (flip 0-4%
vs OpenAI 2-28% / Gemini 0-16%).** Categories E and F (edge/ambiguous) are
hard for all three — bypass 47-89% indicates the prompt's "neutral product
description" rule is too permissive on terse benign-shaped phrasings.

### Run manifest

- **Corpus:** `corpus_hash e1674ba698fe495c11d7d343f3a81fc680bd6139d61174e8641f0d3a53f4325e`, 585 payloads, 11 categories
- **N=5** repeats per payload per model = 2925 rows per slice, 11,700 rows total
- **Concurrency:** 10 (rate-limit aware; Anthropic slice stretched to ~2h on tier-1 quota throttle)
- **Wall:** 2h39m end-to-end (Anthropic 2h dominated; OpenAI/Gemini/Ollama each <45min)
- **Artifacts:**
  - `tests/redteam/runs/2026-04-16T00-48-00-925Z-anthropic-claude-haiku-4-5-20251001.jsonl` ← **re-run (post adapter error-fix)**
  - `tests/redteam/runs/2026-04-15T07-25-57-602Z-anthropic-claude-haiku-4-5-20251001.jsonl` ← original contaminated (archived)
  - `tests/redteam/runs/2026-04-15T19-13-17-306Z-openai-gpt-4o-mini.jsonl`
  - `tests/redteam/runs/2026-04-15T21-15-51-726Z-gemini-gemini-2.5-flash.jsonl`
  - `tests/redteam/runs/2026-04-15T21-58-28-115Z-ollama-gemma4_e2b-it-bf16.jsonl` (errored — see TBD note)
- **Engine path untouched:** `POP_LLM_*` reserved for operator config; sweep adapters read `POP_BENCH_*` exclusively.

### Reproducibility caveat — engine retry-exhaustion fix

The engine (`b890725`) and harness adapters (`826ae40`) now throw typed
errors (`RetryExhausted`, `ProviderUnreachable`, `InvalidResponse`) instead
of returning silent `{approved:false}` fallbacks. The runner maps these
throws to `verdict: "error"`, and the aggregator excludes errors from
bypass/FR, reporting `error_rate` as a separate metric.

The Anthropic re-run has `error_rate = 0.17%` (5/2925 = ProviderUnreachable,
non-retriable). OpenAI has 0.07% (2/2925). Both well under the 1% threshold
where errors would materially affect aggregate numbers.

The original Anthropic run (`2026-04-15T07-25-57Z`) and the Gemini v3 prompt-
iteration run (`2026-04-15T05-02-20Z`) were scored under the pre-fix code
where retry-exhaustion silently became `block` — see Stop-B retraction above.
Those artifacts are archived for audit; their numbers are NOT cited in the
v1 tables above.

### Limitations & next steps

- **Ollama re-run** — needs corrected `POP_BENCH_OLLAMA_MODEL` value. Pending founder confirmation of the locally-installed model name (`ollama list`).
- **Engine fix** — retry-exhaustion → `error` verdict (not silent block). Bundles with vault-hardening release; not blocking v1 publish.
- **Prompt v4** is a candidate for follow-up tuning to specifically lift Cat E/F bypass without re-introducing the FR overcorrection seen in (now-retracted) v2/v3. Out of scope for v1 publish.
- **Single-run snapshot** — all numbers are one sweep. Re-running on a different day will shift each model by a few pp; treat narrow gaps (e.g., OpenAI vs Gemini hybrid bypass 30.1% vs 29.5%) as noise, not signal.
