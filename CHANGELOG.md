# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- **Developer Tools**: Added `AEGIS_UNMASK_CARDS` environment variable to optionally disable card masking (e.g., `****` default) during local testing and E2E validation.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-03-25
### Fixed
- **BYOC Provider Wiring**: `LocalVaultProvider` was not wired into `mcp_server.py`. Real card credentials set via `AEGIS_BYOC_NUMBER` were silently ignored and fell through to `MockStripeProvider`. Added a dedicated BYOC branch to the provider selection logic. Provider priority (high → low): Stripe Issuing → BYOC Local → Mock.

### Added
- **`.env.example`**: Added a full environment variable reference file to the repo root, including all `AEGIS_*` policy variables and the new `AEGIS_BILLING_*` fields.
- **Claude Code Full Setup Guide**: Documented the complete three-component setup for Claude Code (Hacker Edition / BYOC): Chrome CDP launch (`--remote-debugging-port=9222`), Aegis MCP registration with `--project` flag, and Playwright MCP registration with `--cdp-endpoint`. Both MCPs share the same Chrome instance so users can watch the full injection flow live.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-03-23
### Added
- **Browser Automation Layer (`AegisBrowserInjector`)**: Implemented CDP-based cross-origin iframe traversal logic to securely auto-fill real cards for Playwright or browser-use workflows, hiding raw PAN from the agent's context.
- **Optional Dependencies (`[browser]`)**: Added `playwright` directly back into the extra dependencies to streamline installation (`pip install aegis-pay[browser]`).
- **Core Dependencies**: Registered explicitly missing `python-dotenv` for local setups leveraging `LocalVaultProvider`.
- **Scripts Organization**: Moved root `inspect_stripe.py` and `scrape_wiki_donate.py` developer tools to an enclosed `scripts/` directory for cleaner builds.

### Fixed
- **Static Analysis Cleanup**: Removed unused modules like `import asyncio` in `mcp_server.py`, following a Vulture static code analysis pass.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-20
### Added
- **Open-Source Framework Support**: Added explicit MCP configuration and integration documentation for **OpenClaw**, **NemoClaw**, Claude Code, and OpenHands.
- **Multilingual Support**: Added Traditional Chinese (`README.zh-TW.md`) documentation alongside the English version.
- **LLM Provider Flexibility**: `LLMGuardrailEngine` now explicitly supports custom `base_url` and `model` parameters, enabling usage of **Ollama**, **vLLM**, OpenRouter, and any OpenAI-compatible API.
- **Dependency Handling**: Split dependencies into optional extras (`[llm]`, `[stripe]`, `[mcp]`, `[langchain]`, `[all]`) to drastically reduce `pip install aegis-pay` bloat for lightweight agents.
- **Dependency Injection**: `AegisClient` now supports injecting a custom `GuardrailEngine` during initialization.
- **Automated Testing**: Added a comprehensive suite of 20 `pytest` cases covering Pydantic models, budget enforcement, providers, and integration logic.

### Changed
- **MCP Configuration**: The MCP Server is now fully controlled via environment variables (`AEGIS_ALLOWED_CATEGORIES`, `AEGIS_MAX_PER_TX`, `AEGIS_MAX_DAILY`, `AEGIS_BLOCK_LOOPS`, `AEGIS_STRIPE_KEY`) instead of hardcoded policies.
- **State Management**: Migrated from unreliable in-memory lists to a robust SQLite (`aegis_state.db`) back-end (`AegisStateTracker`) with persistent connections.
- **Dashboard Data**: The Streamlit Vault Dashboard now reads directly from the live `aegis_state.db` SQLite database rather than mock data.

### Fixed
- **Daily Budget Enforcement**: Fixed an issue where the daily budget cap was not accurately tracking and blocking agent spend across sequential runs.
- **Stripe Provider Exceptions**: Refactored `StripeIssuingProvider` to gracefully catch and return explicit `stripe.StripeError` codes as formal rejection reasons instead of crashing the agent workflow.
- **Cardholder API**: Fixed the Stripe implementation by properly generating a `Cardholder` object before attempting to issue virtual cards.
- **Burn-after-use Security**: Implemented validation to ensure requested execution attempts correctly utilize issued `seal_id` mapping.

## [0.1.0] - Early 2026
### Added
- Initial release of Project Aegis (AgentPay).
- Basic `GuardrailPolicy`, `VirtualSeal`, and `PaymentIntent` Pydantic models.
- Minimal MVP Streamlit Dashboard (The Vault).
- Initial `MockStripeProvider` for testing workflows.
